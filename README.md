- The code structure if pretty simple. The code is completely modularized and is highly customizable.

## Future Improvements
- Generalized conversations can be made possible by incorporating Natural Language Processing
- Addying more languages with english
- GUI can be made more nicer to look at and functional
- More functionalities can be added.
